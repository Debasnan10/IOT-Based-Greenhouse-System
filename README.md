# IoT Based Greenhouse Monitoring And Controlling System

## Introduction
Agriculture is pivotal to India's economy and the well-being of its people. The IoT Green House Project aims to enhance agricultural production through an embedded system for soil monitoring and irrigation. This system reduces manual labor and delivers real-time data via a mobile application. It leverages various sensors to test soil and suggests appropriate crops, facilitating automatic irrigation and pesticide suggestions.

## Proposed System
The project measures parameters like temperature, humidity, CO2, and soil moisture using sensors and a Raspberry Pi. Digital sensors are interfaced with an MCP3008 ADC for accurate digital conversion. The system employs LED lights to simulate sunlight, a blubber for humidity, and a sump motor for irrigation, all controlled through a webpage designed with HTML, CSS, and phpMyAdmin for database management.

## Aim and Objectives
The greenhouse creates a specific environment for plant needs, allowing for off-season cultivation and protection against pests. It aims to provide a controlled setting to maximize plant growth and production year-round.

## System Requirements
1. Software Requirements:
- Raspbian OS: A Debian-based OS for Raspberry Pi.
- VNC Viewer: For remote control of another computer.
- Apache Server: Open-source web server software.
- PhpMyAdmin: A free software tool for MySQL administration.
- MySQL: An open-source RDBMS that uses SQL.

2. Hardware Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi 3B: A powerful single-board computer with wireless LAN & Bluetooth connectivity.
- Relay Board: For switching applications in the greenhouse system.
- Float Level Sensor: To measure the water level in tanks.
- Solenoid Valve: For controlling water flow.
- DHT22: To measure temperature and humidity.
- MCP3008: An ADC for interfacing with analog sensors.
- MQ2 Gas Sensor: For detecting levels of LPG, smoke, and alcohol.
- Led Grow Light Modular: To provide artificial sunlight to plants.

## Methodology
The project utilizes both analog and digital sensors interfaced with a Raspberry Pi. The system's block diagram outlines the integration of sensors, actuators, and database management for real-time monitoring and control.

## Hardware Design
The glasshouse is meticulously designed with specified dimensions for optimal plant growth. It includes soil beds for cultivation, LED grow lights for photosynthesis, and sensors for environmental control.

## Advantages and Applications
The project offers numerous advantages, such as efficient light distribution, energy efficiency, microclimate control, and increased production. It is applicable in cultivating off-season crops, ornamental plants, and in regions with adverse weather conditions.

## Conclusion and Future Scope
The IoT Green House Project marks a significant step towards modernizing agriculture with technology. Future enhancements may include camera module integration for crop status monitoring, pH sensor addition for soil health, and machine learning algorithms for climate control.
